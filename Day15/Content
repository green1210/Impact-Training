Day 15:

// LINEAR SĒARCH & BINARY SEARCH:-

// LINEAR SEARCH:-

-> To search the elements in the given array in a linear array. 
-> Whenever the length of array is smaller there use linear search and the time complexity will be 0(n).

// BINARY SEARCH:-

-> To search the elements from the given array in less time complexity.
-> The time complexity for binary search is O(log n).

STEPS:-
1. Initialize left pointer at 0, right pointer at n-1
2. Run the loop from left to right, break the loop when left and right process each other
3. Find the middle value.
4. If arr[mid] = target, return mid
5. If arr[mid] < to the target value then the element will be left half of the array.
6. If the element present in the left half, left pointer will remains same , right point will move to n-1.
7. If arr[mid] > to the target value then the element present in right half of array.
-> Array should be sorted.
