Data Structure & Algorithms:

* Data Structure : Arrangement of data in a structured format which can be customizable to easy and fast access with less time   
  complexity.
  
   - In array memory allocation is continuous, so access time will be more and code will be messy.
   - In Data Structure memory allocation is random, so access time will be less.

* Algorithms : Mathematicals solutions or method which is used to write the code simple and better way.

* Examples of Data Structure :  Stack, Queue, LinkedList, Tree, Graph, Heap.

* Examples of Algorithms : Dutch national flag, sliding window, Greedy.

Time Complexity:

* The amount of time required to compile a code.
* Key Points :
 - Ignore Constants.
 - Ignore Small Values.
 - Focus on worst case.

* Example :
             1.for(0 - n)
                 for(0 - n)
             2.for(0 - n)
             3.O(1)

 - the time complexity will be : n^2 + n + 1 = n^2
 - because we always consider the worst case senariores.

Space Complexity:

* The amount space required for the code.
* Extra space we use in code increases the space complexity.
* Use case of data structure : Browser(linkedlist), Google maps(Graph), Social Media(Graph)
