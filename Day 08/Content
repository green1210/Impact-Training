RECURSIONS:-
-> Recursions are nothing but it and its self
// Two Types
-> Function calling same function it self and it self 
-> Function calling another function it self and it self 

-> If we didn't mention base case properly will get an exception called stack overflow.
-> Recursions are used to break the code.

Q) Write the code for factorial using recursions.
  5! = 5*4!
  4! = 4*3!
  3! = 3*2!
  2! = 2*1!
  1! = 1*0!
-> All the return values will be pushed into a stack, whenever we hits base condition the elements will be popped.

factorial{
  if(n==0){
    return 1;
}else{
  return N*fact(n-1)
   } 
 }
