//Switch case:
 - case have to be same type as expressions, must be a constant or literal
 - Duplicate case values are not allowed
 - break is used to terminate the sequence
 - if break is not used, it will continue to next case
 - default will execute if none of the above  does
 - if  default is not at end , put break after it

* Example:
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
      switch (expression){
       case :
           statement;
           break;
       default:
           statement;
   }
}
