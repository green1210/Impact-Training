//Static block:
using static keyword static block is created, it is a single ton block.

static method:
for static method no need to create object static.
it will acts as instance of object and using class name you call static method

Example :
import java.util.*;

class Animal{
   static void eat(){
      System.out.println("Animal is Eating:");
}
}

class Dog extends Animal{
static void eat(){
      System.out.println("Dog is Eating:");
}
}

public class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){

Animal.eat();
Dog.eat();
}
}





//Non Static :
we need object to access the method or block

Example :
import java.util.*;

class Animal{
   void eat(){
      System.out.println("Animal is Eating:");
}
}

class Dog extends Animal{

    void eat(){
      System.out.println("Dog is Eating:");
}
}

public class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
Animal obj = new Animal();
obj.eat();
}
}


//Constructor:
constructor is used to initialize the object(creating of objects).
it call default constructor for to create objects.

//Conditional Statements
conditional statement are used to get output in constant time

control statements or control loops
types:
1.entry control : for, while
2.exit control : Do-while

for loop:
for(start(initialization) ; End(condition); diff(increment/Decrement){
}

while(End(condition){
diff(Increment/Decrement)
}

when you know the range use for loop and don't know range use while loop
