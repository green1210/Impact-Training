* every problem there will be 3 types of solutions:
1.brute force
2.Better
3.Optimal

1.brute force:
- Most of Brute force Solutions will get using 2 loops
- Most of the solutions will be 2 loops(Nested loop)


//Pattern Printing:

* There are 3 Ways
1.print no of rows
2.print no of columns
3.print what to print and what not to print

Address Mapping:
