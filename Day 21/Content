// sorting Algorithms:

- Alorithms are used to sort the data in accesending or descending order.
- Ex: merge, bubble, radical, quick, insertion, heap.

* Bubble Sorting: 
 - selecting the adjacent elements, compare the the element and swap them.
 - after the completion of every iteration the weightest and lightest element will go the end.
 - Best case : n
 - worst case : n^2

* Selection ort:
 - Selecting the element at right place irrespective of array elements.
 - best case and worst case is n^2.

- Seudo Code:
     for(i=0->n-1){
     small =i;
        for(j=i+1->n-i-1){
             if(ar[j] < arr[i]{
                  small=j;
                  swap(arr[i],arr[j])
                   }
      }

// Queue 
- Queue is linear data structure.
- fifo
- Types of queues:

  1.single ended
  2.double ended 
  3.circular
  4.priority
    - min queue
    - max queue

* step:
- initialize the 2 pointers, front and rare.'
- enqueue element at rare end.
- dequeue the element at front end.
