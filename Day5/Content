//arrays
 
int a = 2;
int b = 3;
int c = 4;

all the reference names will be stored in stack memory
all the values assigned to those variable will be stored in heap memory.

in above we have same data type for all the block, to store same type of data we use array.

array : It is a collection of similar type of data in a continuous allocation.

if variable a is stored at Address 100 then the second value of array should be allocated at 104
